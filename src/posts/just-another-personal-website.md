If I had to count on my fingers how many times I've started a blog, programmed and published it, and then without posting anything, thrown it away - one hand wouldn't be enough.

This time, however, I'm trying a slightly different approach. I don't put great expectations on myself and I see the blog as a work in progress. I'll just write - whether it's just short notes, longer explorations, or some useful tutorials, recipes – and what (if anything) will come out of it, time will tell.

And I believe that for it to work in the long run, it should servd first and foremost to myself – meaning that even no one is ever going to read it, it still makes sense to write.

I started keeping a journal after being on a retreat away from people and for the first time I managed to keep it up for several days in a row, so I would like to continue. So far I've been sharing it on are.na, but it'll be nicer to read it here.
