## Ingredients

(8 servings)

- 200g dried chickpeas, soaked overnight, drained (or 450g cooked)
- 1/2 onion, coarsely chopped
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 3/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
- 3 tablespoons chickpea flour
- 3 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cardamom
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- vegetable oil (for frying)
- pita with pockets (for serving)

## Special Equipment

- food processor
- large pot for frying

## Instructions

1. If using dried chickpeas, soak them in water overnight or for at least 8 hours. Drain and rinse before using.

2. In a food processor, pulse the chickpeas until they resemble finely chopped nuts. Don't overprocess, as a coarse texture is key to a light and fluffy falafel.

3. Add the onion, jalapeño, garlic, cilantro, and parsley to the food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped.

4. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and stir in the chickpea flour, salt, baking powder, cardamom, and cumin.

5. Form the mixture into slightly flatten the balls to create patties.

6. In a large, heavy pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat until hot enough.

7. Working in batches, carefully place the falafel balls into the pot and fry until deep brown and crisp, about 5 minutes.

8. Remove the falafel with a slotted spoon and place on paper towels to drain excess oil. Let sit for 5 minutes.

9. Serve the falafel hot with pita, tahini sauce, and salad.

## Notes

- If using canned chickpeas, you can skip the soaking step and use 2 cans of drained and rinsed chickpeas instead of the dried chickpeas.
- If the mixture is too wet and sticky, add more chickpea flour to help bind it together.
- For a healthier option, you can bake the falafel balls in a preheated oven at 400°F for 20-25 minutes, flipping them halfway through.
