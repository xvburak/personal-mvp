Well, this really got to me emotionally. I was already feeling a bit down before watching it, but this movie was the final straw for me. The storyline about a couple who had grown apart and were getting divorced really hit close to home.

However, I have to admit that I appreciated the realism of the plot. It wasn't the typical Hollywood romance that ends with a happily-ever-after. Instead, it showed the messy reality of relationships and the struggles that come with them. The chemistry between the two main characters was palpable and made their situation all the more heartbreaking.

Overall, I thought this movie was well-done and appropriately matched what I'm going through in my own life right now. If you're in the mood for a realistic and emotional love story, then I definitely recommend giving this one a watch.
