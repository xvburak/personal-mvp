The theme of quarter-life crisis is something that I know personaly. The feeling of being capable of anything and nothing at the same time. The sense that everyone around you is ahead in life while you're falling behind. The pressure to have it all figured out and yet still longing for a carefree childhood. All of that is present in this film.
