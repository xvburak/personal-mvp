At the age of 25, I'm just geting into reading fiction, so I'm quite slow reader. However, this book really grabbed my attention, and I managed to finish it in a week, which is quite fast for me. What I liked about it is the world of game development, even though there aren't many references to real-life events. The book explores the idea that finding a partner and friend with whom your creative processes perfectly match is rare, even more so than finding a romantic partner.

The story revolves around video games, and the main characters, Sadie and Sam, play, talk about, design, and promote them over a period of thirty years. What impressed me is that despite not being into video games that much, the author, Gabrielle Zevin, kept me glued to the pages. I never lost interest in Sadie and Sam's lives, both in the real world and the virtual worlds they created.

In fact, Sadie and Sam are the most memorable characters I've come across in the past years of my reading journey. This book beautifully combines their passion for gaming with their everyday lives, making it an enjoyable and thought-provoking read. It's a great choice for a relaxed summer reading experience.
