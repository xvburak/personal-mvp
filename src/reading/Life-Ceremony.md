Life Ceremony is a collection of twelve short stories by Sayaka Murata that left me with mixed emotions. The author's writing style is minimalistic yet powerful, and she effortlessly creates a world that is both eerie and captivating. The stories are full of strange characters, and each one is thought-provoking, making me question the norms and traditions of our society.

I loved how the stories were unpredictable and often ended abruptly, leaving me with a sense of curiosity and intrigue. The author's ability to create an atmosphere of otherworldly imagination and uncanniness is impressive, and some stories reminded me of the TV show Black Mirror, but with a subtler touch.

One of my favorite stories was "Hatchling," as it struck a chord with me. It portrays the struggle of someone trying too hard to fit in, and their fractured personality resonated with me. Murata's ability to make me empathize with the characters and relate to their problems is what made this collection a standout for me.

Overall, Life Ceremony is an excellent collection of thought-provoking stories that will linger with you long after you've finished reading. Murata's ability to mix humor and horror is impressive, and I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a unique and captivating read.
